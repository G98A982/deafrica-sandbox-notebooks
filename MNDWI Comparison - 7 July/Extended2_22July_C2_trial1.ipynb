    "### Analysis-Ready Data (ARD): the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 data\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite operators, such as the USGS, perform pre-processing on raw satellite data before releasing it for use. The amount of pre-processing differs between products. The USGS taxonomy for the these differing amounts of pre-processing is ordered by `Collections` and `Levels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Collections` indicate the data meets a standardised set of metrics for quality and type of pre-processing. This is consistent within the collection, but varies between collections. For example, Collection 2 uses more advanced data processing than Collection 1. At time of writing, only Collection 1 is available for general use.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Levels` indicate the amount of pre-processing. Higher-level data has undergone more pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we examine in this notebook is from the `USGS Collection 1` archive for the satellite `Landsat 8`. We look at both `Level 1` and `Level 2` data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collection 1, Level 1 data** : Level 1 data is very close to its raw format, it can be flexibly manipulated by the scientific community, but requires specialist knowledge to use. Atmospheric interference and other underlying satellite data issues are not corrected for.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Collection 1, Level 2 data**: The accessibility of available satellite data can be significantly increased by further processing the Level 1 data, such as by applying atmospheric corrections. Level 2 data is hosted on DE Africa's `OpenDataCube`, and is known as `Analysis-Ready Data (ARD)`. The corrections improve the overall quality of the data (compared to the Level 1 data) and allow users to conduct analysis independent of expertise in the data corrections process. The terms `ARD` and `Level 2 data` will be used interchangeably in this notebook."

    "### Modified Normalised Difference Water Index (MNDWI)\n",
    "\n",
    "MNDWI is a variation on the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI). NDWI is used to detect the presence of water bodies in remote sensing, and is calculated using the Green band and Near-Infrared (NIR) bands from satellite data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \\text{NDWI} \\ = \\ \\frac{\\text{Green} - \\text{NIR}}{\\text{Green} + \\text{NIR}} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it has been shown that using a Short-Range Infrared (SWIR) band instead of NIR provides enhanced delineation between water and other types of areas (soil, vegetation, built-up land). This gives the Modified NDWI, or MNDWI.\n",

    "\\begin{equation} \\text{MNDWI} \\ = \\ \\frac{\\text{Green} - \\text{SWIR}}{\\text{Green} + \\text{SWIR}} \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Landsat 8 satellite data, which has two SWIR bands, SWIR 1 is used. The indices are normalised, which means their values range from -1 to 1. Generally, this can be interpreted as:\n",

    "This notebook will show how ARD (Level 2) data differs from the less pre-processed Level 1 data. This is done by calculating MNDWI using Level 1 data and Level 2 data from Landsat 8, for the same region. Differences in the MDNWI between the datasets demonstrate the enhanced usability of ARD over Level 1 data.\n",

    "1. Fulfill prerequisites: select a location for analysis and download Level 1 data.\n",
    "2. Load Level 1 data for the location.\n",
    "3. Load Level 2 data for the location.\n",
    "4. Calculate MNDWI for the Level 1 data.\n",
    "5. Calculate MNDWI for the Level 2 data.\n",
    "6. Compare the Level 1 and Level 2 data by plotting them together. The analysis includes:\n",
    "    * A close-up, small region comparison of MNDWI\n",
    "    * Thresholding MNDWI at 0 to show noise in Level 1 data\n",
    "    * Calculation of a suitable threshold for the Level 1 dataset\n",
    "    * Using optimised thresholds for MNDWI to calculate and compare waterlines\n",

    "The Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) sandbox does not index Landsat 8 Level 1 data. This means Level 1 data must be manually downloaded from the USGS website before it can be imported into the notebook. A time and place for analysis must be decided.\n",

    "* Choosing location\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this notebook, a mix of water and land areas is desireable. An area off the coast of Guinea-Bissau has been selected. This is centred around the following coordinates:\n",

    "`lat = 11.228`<br>\n",
    "`lon = -15.860`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choosing time\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, MNDWI is calculated for a single instance in time. The period of time chosen for this notebook was `January 2018`. Fortuitously, there is only one \"scene\" (satellite flyover) for the chosen location during the month of January 2018. If there were multiple flyovers, only one would have been selected.\n",

    "* Downloading Level 1 data\n",

    "By browsing the `Day` dropdown, the only scene encapsulating the Bissau coast is `9 January 2018`. Click `11 datasets available` on the right-hand toolbar to open details of each scene taken on that day.

Note this code; it is the `Scene ID` and will be needed later for datacube imports. Note the `Locations > Active:` field as it shows the naming convention for this scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the [USGS Landsat 8 registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/landsat-8/) and access their AWS S3 Bucket. The file naming convention is the same as the `Locations > Active` field in the DE Africa Explorer; i.e. look for a folder starting with `LC08_L1TP_204052_20180109_20180119_01_T1`. \n",

However, the Level 1 data, which does not contain atmospheric corrections, generally requires a custom-calculated threshold to optimise MNDWI. Calculating suitable thresholds is at minimum one extra step, and due to the variation in Level 1 data, could require recalculation for different scenes.\n",

This can be seen in the Level 1 data, where it is necessary to have a clear, cloud-free day to obtain useful readings. However, Level 2 data has been pre-processed to remove some of this noise, and is less dependent on favourable weather conditions. This effectively increases the temporal resolution of the dataset, as scenes do not have to be discarded due to cloud cover."
