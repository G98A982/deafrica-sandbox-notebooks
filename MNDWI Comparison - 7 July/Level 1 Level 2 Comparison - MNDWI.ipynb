    "\n",
    "Satellite operators, such as USGS, perform minimal processing on the data before releasing it for general consumption. This is known as **Level 1 data**. As Level 1 data is very close to its raw form, it can be flexibly manipulated by the scientific community, but requires specialist knowledge to use. Atmospheric interference and other underlying satellite data issues must be corrected for before the data shows meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accessibility of available satellite data can therefore be significantly increased by further processing the Level 1 data, such as by applying atmospheric corrections. This processed data is hosted on the OpenDataCube, and is known as **Level 2 data** or **Analysis-Ready Data**, shortened to **ARD**. The corrections improve the overall quality of the data (compared to the Level 1 data) and allow users to conduct analysis independent of expertise in the data corrections process."
